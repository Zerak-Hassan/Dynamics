With this program I aim to simulate various dynamics situations to allow for better visulisation of the systems:
Single and multi degree of freedom systems with both linear and tortional charateristic dimentions. Also with various inputs forces and displacements.
Rotor dynamics. Balanced and unbalanced shafts and stiffnesses
Continous systems (Longitudinal, torsional and transverse)
